World Event

1. Every time a phrase is activated, it's possible to be a world changing
event. 

2. For example, if you have WALL IS BOBA, it will make all the walls Bobas.
If you have ROCK IS PUSH, all of the rocks are pushable. 

3. In the first example, all of the WALLS will now look like BOBAS and do
whatever BOBA is set to do. If BOBA is PUSH, then walls will also be PUSH.

4. The only new entities that get created after the game starts are sparkles
(for items that are WIN) and dust that follows whatever is YOU.
