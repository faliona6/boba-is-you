How It Works!

(I highly recommend playing the game before watching the video! Since it is a puzzle game, it's not as fun if you
already know the answer)

	MOVE (arrow keys also work) :
		w - up		
		a - left
		s - down
		d - right
		
	RESTART : r
	NEXT STAGE (after you beat it) : mouse button
	
	Move around and solve the puzzles by making the rules of the world the way you want it. This game is inspired by 
	the game Baba is You.
